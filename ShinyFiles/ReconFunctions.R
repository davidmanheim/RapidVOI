# Reconsider evidence function 

# must return everything that the normal analysis does + the delay analysis
# just add into the regular functions with an if statement!
#if(reconsider == "Yes"){
#  
#  # insert reconsideration of evidence function
#  
#}


# extensions: calculate NB of other strategies other than the max strategy
# only calculates value of learning about the relative effect parameter
# continuous and survival outcomes
# how to maintain correlations??
# only works on Odds Ratio inputs - could extend to RR and RD, (and contin + survival)

# 0) overall
# ReconBinary, ReconContinuous, ReconSurvial
# 
# input: vector indicating which treatments will be reconsidered c(0,1,0) [only reconisder second treatment]


# 1) Bayesian bit:
# simulate the possible situations after the reconsideration study has reported
# 
# inputs: mu_prior (mean LOR for prior), variance_prior, variance_study (the expected uncertainty in the study results assumed known with no uncertainty), 
# LOR_prior_vec (draws from LOR prior ~ N(mu_prior, variance_prior))
# MCsimsInner
# outputs: mu_post_vec, variance_post (assumed known with no uncertainty)
# method
# mu_liklihood <- rnorm(1, LOR_prior_vec, variance_study)
# tau_liklihood <- tau_study
# mu_post_vec <- see notes
# variance_post <- see notes


# 2) start loop
# for each simulation of mu_post_vec: mu_post_i

# 2.1) Probability bit
# 
# inputs: mu_post_i, variance_post, P_t1 (vector of length MCsimsOuter - may have to cut down the ususal MCsims)
# output: P_t_i (matrix of probabilities for each treatment)

# 2.2) Net benefit bit
# PMatrixToNBMatrix function 
#
# inputs: P_t_i, the specific inputs for 
# output: NB_t_i (matrix of net benefits for each treatment)

# 2.3) EVPI bit
# 
# input: NB_t_i
# output: EVTPI_post_vec, EVTCI_post_vec
#
# end loop

# 3) Decision value bit
#
# input: EVTPI_post_vec, EVTCI_post_vec, population, discount, special costs,...
# output: NB of the max strategy: always implement the best with current info
